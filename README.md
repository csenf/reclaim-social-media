reclaim social media
====================

reclaim social media version .2, based on reclaim social media version .1 by [felix schwenzel](http://reclaim.fm), sascha lobo. 

itâ€™s a single wordpress plugin by remigi illi at [digitaleheimat.de](http://digitaleheimat.de), instead of a collection of proxy-scripts and 3rd party plugins. The code of the early version can be fount at github ([proxy scripts]( https://github.com/diplix/reclaim-proxy-scripts)) and the [reclaim.fm site](http://reclaim.fm/tech-specs-details/).

The plugin is still pretty raw but should be a pretty good basis for further develpment.
